Product concept
We provide hourly historical weather data for any location on the globe via History API. Availability of hourly historical data depends on a type of your subscription.

You can also download this data in JSON or CSV format - please read History Bulk and History Forecast Bulk.

Call hourly historical data
How to make an API call
API call

https://history.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/history/city?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&type=hour&start={start}&end={end}&appid={API key}

https://history.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/history/city?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&type=hour&start={start}&cnt={cnt}&appid={API key}

Parameters
lat	required	Latitude. If you need the geocoder to automatic convert city names and zip-codes to geo coordinates and the other way around, please use our Geocoding API
lon	required	Longitude. If you need the geocoder to automatic convert city names and zip-codes to geo coordinates and the other way around, please use our Geocoding API
type	required	Type of the call, keep this parameter in the API call as hour
appid	required	Your unique API key (you can always find it on your account page under the "API key" tab)
start	optional	Start date (unix time, UTC time zone), e.g. start=1369728000
end	optional	End date (unix time, UTC time zone), e.g. end=1369789200
cnt	optional	A number of timestamps in response (one per hour, can be used instead of the parameter end)
Please use Geocoder API if you need automatic convert city names and zip-codes to geo coordinates and the other way around.

Please note that built-in geocoder has been deprecated. Although it is still available for use, bug fixing and updates are no longer available for this functionality.

Example of API call

https://history.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/history/city?lat=41.85&lon=-87.65&appid={API key}


If you do not see some of the parameters in your API response it means that these weather phenomena are just not happened for the time of measurement for the city or location chosen. Only really measured or calculated data is displayed in API response.

Min/max temperature in historical weather API and forecast API
Please, do not confuse min/max parameters in hourly historical weather API and forecast API. In hourly historical weather API temp_min and temp_max are optional parameters mean min / max temperature in the city at the moment of calculation to show deviation from the average temperature just for your reference. For large cities and megalopolises geographically expanded it might be applicable. In most cases both temp_min and temp_max parameters have the same volume as 'temp'. Please, use temp_min and temp_max parameters optionally.

Only for Professional and Expert plans: The maximum historical data depth in one API response is one week.
If you specify a historical data depth more than one week in the request, you will receive a historical data only for first week from start date in one API response.

If you want to get the historical data depth more than one week, then please use several queries.
